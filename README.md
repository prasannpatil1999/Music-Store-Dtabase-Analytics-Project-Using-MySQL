### Project Overview
The Music Store Database Analytics Project aims to analyze sales, customer preferences, and product performance to gain insights into trends in the music industry. By examining factors such as top-selling genres, customer demographics, and revenue distribution across different formats, the project helps optimize inventory management and marketing strategies for better business decisions.

### Tools Used
- MySQL

### Data Sources
The Music_Store_database.sql file contains structured data related to a music store, including tables for customers, sales transactions, music genres, albums, artists, and payment details. This dataset helps analyze sales trends, customer purchasing behavior, and revenue distribution across different music categories and formats.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
- In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

1. Imported data into the MySQL database and conducted an inspection.
2. No duplicates, null and blank values are found
3. Checked for spelling errors, typos, and inconsistencies. None were found.

### Key Business Questions Answered
- TASK 1: Who is the senior most employee based on job title?
- TASK 2: Which countries have the most invoices?
- TASK 3: What are Top 3 values of total invoices?
- TASK 4: Q4: Which city has the best customers? We would like to throw a promotional Music Festival in the city we made the most money?
- TASK 5: Who is the best customer? The customer who has spent the most money will be declared the best customer. 

- TASK 6: Write query to return the email, first name, last name, & Genre of all Rock Music listeners. 
- TASK 7:: Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset. 
- TASK 8:Return all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length. 

- TASK 9: Find how much amount spent by each customer on artists? Write a query to return customer name, artist name and total spent?
- TASK 10: We want to find out the most popular music Genre for each country. 
- TASK 11: Write a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on music for each country.

### Recommendations
- Expand the Italian Menu: Since the highest-spending orders are dominated by Italian dishes, consider adding new Italian dishes or premium options.
- Promote High-Selling Items: The Hamburger (American) and Chicken Tacos (Mexican) are the most ordered items‚Äîpromoting them with combo deals or upsell strategies can increase revenue.
- Analyze Low-Selling Items: Identify and improve or remove menu items with low sales to optimize the menu.
- Optimize Pricing Strategy: With Italian dishes having the highest average price, introducing mid-range Italian options may attract more customers.
- Enhance Order Size Growth: Since some orders contain over 12 items, encourage group or family meal deals to increase the average order size.
- Target High-Spending Customers: Create loyalty programs or discounts for repeat high-value customers, especially those ordering Italian cuisine frequently.

### Conclusion
The Restaurant Order Data Analysis provides valuable insights into customer preferences, sales trends, and menu performance. Italian dishes emerge as the most popular and highest-grossing category, indicating a strong demand. Optimizing the menu by expanding high-selling items, adjusting pricing strategies, and promoting group deals can enhance revenue. Implementing targeted marketing and loyalty programs for frequent high-spending customers can further boost profitability.
